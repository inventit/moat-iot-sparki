MOAT IoT Application Example
========
Sparki Example for OSGi
--------

This OSGi bundle is a gateway between [Sparki](http://arcbotics.com/products/sparki/), an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) based easy robot, and ServiceSync Sandbox Cloud with [MOAT PubSub API](http://dev.inventit.io/references/moat-pubsub-api-document.html).

See [the tutorial](http://dev.inventit.io/guides/get-started.html) to learn more.

This project already includes an OSGi container, Apache Felix 4.4.1. However, it is possible to deploy this bundle to other OSGi containers.
